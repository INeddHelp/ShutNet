# What's this?

ShutNet, is a 'virus'(it is not) that shuts down every device connected to your wifi. 

# How does it work? 

You just need to download the .zip file and follow the instructions.
However, to run the script you must need the administrative privileges.

No, it will not.

P.S. I suggest you to not try the exe file its a WIP
