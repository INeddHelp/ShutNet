# What's this?

ShutNet, is a 'virus'(it is not) that shuts down every device connected to your wifi. 

# How does it work? 

You just need to download the .zip file and follow the instructions.
However, to run the script you must need the administrative privileges.

# Will it cause any harm to any device?

No, it will not.

P.S. I suggest you to not try the exe file its a WIP

# Instructions

-  Download and extract the zip / tar.gz file
-  Make sure you are connected to a wifi connection
-  Open 'powershell' with the administator privileges
-  -  Paste this line into the terminal: 'ExecutionPolicy Bypass (On Windows: 'powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass')'
-  -  Now navigate with the 'cd' command to the directory of the extracted Content
-  -  Now run the command .\ShutNet.ps1
-  -  Press enter and after the command executed you can safely close the terminal
Enjoy!
