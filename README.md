# What's this?

ShutNet, is a 'virus'(it is not) that shuts down every device connected to your wifi. 

# How does it work? 

You just need to download the file ShutNet.bat and run it ON WINDOWS, after that the code will run.
However, to run the script you must need the administrative privileges.

# Will it cause any harm to any device?

No, it will not.

P.S. I suggest you to not try the exe file its a WIP
